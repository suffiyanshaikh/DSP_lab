# DSP_lab

### Overview

The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate digital signal processing using Python programming. Generating discrete signals and performing DSP operations such as filtering, compression, and modulation. We'll use Python and the Google Colab environment to study how discrete signals can be generated and signal processing  operations can be performed.
